### Welcome to the `tigerTree` R-package!

`tigerTree` is designed to facilitate the teaching of elementary statistics with the R programming language, especially in the RStudio integrated development environment.  In particular, it provides some helper functions to permit students to build tree models using the `tree` package and to test these models.

The menu items in the Navbar above describe some of the main features of the package.  Instructors should consult the Instructor Notes.  Students and instructors will find the Vignettes helpful:  they offer tutorials on commonly-used functions specific to the `tigerTree` package as well as R-functions from other packages that play an important role in how the subject of classfication and regression trees is taught to elementary stuents at the home institution of the package author.

`tigerTree` may be downloaded from its Github repository:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("homerhanumat/tigertree")
```
